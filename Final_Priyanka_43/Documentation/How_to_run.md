# Computational Final Project
Task: Use the Location (GPS) app to record the spatial locations of how you move along the outline of a sine wave.

This project contains three folder:

1. Code

2. data

3. Documentation

## Code:
This folder contains Final.py and test_final.py python module which contains 
- function that converts Fahrenheit to Kelvin
- parser that reads out the temperature of one markdown file
- filename lister that generates programmatically (using the python os library) a list of your markdown file based on a filename filter
- non-linear fitting in pure python which includes the functionality to specify the step number of 2^n
- numpy wrapper for fft, inverse fft, including functionality that checks for non-equidistant data
- pure python (no numpy) to calculate the frequency axis in useful units

## Data:
This folder contains data for sinewalk in .csv and .md file for 10 and 20 walks.

## Documentation: 
This folder contains final.ipynb which has three figures.

## Requirements:
- numpy: **NumPy** is a Python library used for efficient numerical computations, supporting operations on arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions like FFT, linear algebra, and statistical analysis.
- pandas: **Pandas** is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrames to handle and analyze structured data efficiently.
- matplotlib: **Matplotlib** is a Python library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations, such as plots and graphs.
- scipy: **SciPy** is a Python library used for scientific and technical computing, providing functions for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, and other advanced mathematical operations.
