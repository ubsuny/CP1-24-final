# Midterm 24 - data read and process

This is the midterm for CP1-24 based on getting and using research data using the phyphox app (https://phyphox.org).

*Data task: 9 points*
- Use the Location (GPS) app to record the spatial locations of how you move along the outline of the  following two geometric elements:
   - a circle with a diameter of at least $d = \frac{500\rm{ft}}{\pi}$
   - a right triangle with at least $a = 80 \rm{ft}$ and $b = 50 \rm{yd}$
- Use the Acceleration (without g) app to record the linear accelaration in $x,y,z$ for the following events:
   - Take the elevator in any UB north campus building from the lowest to the top floor
   - Take the elevator in any UB north campus building from the top to the lowest floor
- After each experiment export all collected data as csv files and generate an additional markdown file (named following this pattern: `"unique id"_"experiment name".md`, e.g. `LL009_gps_circle_run09.md`) with the following meta information:
   - Date and time of the experiment
   - Current weather conditions
   - Any additional information regarding the experiment

*Algorithm  task: (15 points):*
- write the following python modules that implement importable functions:
   - for a unit converter for feet and yard to an SI equivalent (2p)
   - that calculate the distance between two adjacent GPS positions (from the recorded data from the data task) (bonus point if you consider the earth not being flat) (5p)
   - that calculate the direction of motion from the recorded acceleration data (from the data task) (5p)
   - to read out the data and time from each metafile and convert it into unix time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (3p)
- All python modules have to be linted using pylint (https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and get a full score using the default settings to get full points.
- Only python libraries listed in requirements.txt can be used

*Documentation task: (12 points):*
- Generate docstrings for your modules and functions (4 points).
- Generate *one* figure of your GPS motions in a x,y plane and save it as a png file (2 points)
- Generate *one* figure of your directions in the elevator over time and save it as a png file (2 points)
- Describe in a seperate markdown file how to run your code (4 points).

*Tools task: (6 points):*
- Write unit tests using the pytest framework for all modules. Tests have to be in a seperate file following the pattern `test_*.py` (4 points).
- Add a bibliography in your documentation and references to all sources you used (2 points).

## How to work on your midterm project on github

1. you have to work on a fork of the original ubsuny project
2. you have to submit your work to the original ubsuny project via a *single* pull request
3. all your work has to be in a folder that is called "your github username"
4. inside that folder you have to seperate you work in several subfolders:
     - data
     - code
     - documentation (contains figures and how to run the code)
